## Background Context
In this project, you learn different caching algorithms.

## Resources
### Read or watch:
* [Cache replacement policies - FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#First_In_First_Out_%28FIFO%29)
* [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Last_In_First_Out_%28LIFO%29)
* [Cache replacement policies - LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_Recently_Used_%28LRU%29)
* [Cache replacement policies - MRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Most_Recently_Used_%28MRU%29)
* [Cache replacement policies - LFU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least-Frequently_Used_%28LFU%29)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), without the help of Google:
### General
* What a caching system is
* What FIFO means
* What LIFO means
* What LRU means
* What MRU means
* What LFU means
* What the purpose of a caching system
* What limits a caching system have

## Requirements
* A ```README.md``` file.

## Tasks
* [x] 0. Basic dictionary
* [x] 1. FIFO caching
* [x] 2. LIFO Caching
* [x] 3. LRU Caching
* [x] 4. MRU Caching
* [x] 5. LFU Caching
